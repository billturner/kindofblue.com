Hi! I'm Bill Turner. I'm a father, husband, developer, and former-Texan living in Pittsburgh, PA. I'm currently employed as a senior full-stack developer by the fine folks at [Healthie](https://www.gethealthie.com/ 'The Healthie homepage').

This is, _I think_, about the tenth weblog I've started, and it's probably not the last. Over the years, I've use home-rolled (with Perl, Ruby (Merb, Sinatra, Ruby on Rails)), WordPress, Blogger, Drupal, Moveable Type and other software to make a weblog. At the moment, I'm back to using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ 'The Jekyll website') and I'm using a modification of the [Whiteglass theme](https://github.com/yous/whiteglass 'The Whiteglass theme Github page') for the presentation.

### About the name

The name, Kind of Blue, comes from the [Miles Davis jazz album](http://amzn.to/2fBqDIU 'Buy this wonderful album, via Amazon.com') of the same name. Other than being named after the album, there is no specific meaning.
