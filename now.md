In the spirit of [Derek Sivers'](https://sivers.org/ "Derek Sivers' website") ["now page"](http://nownownow.com/about 'About the now page'), here is a list of things I'm currently doing my best to focus my attention on.

- Keep up with some sort of artistic activity
  > I haven't done much with ink or watercolors, but I have been working at making some paper collages. In February of 2025, I did a month-long series of collages with the "Februllage" prompts. Some were good, and some were okay. However, I had a lot of fun. This year I'm going to keep up with making collages and dip into sketching when I can.

  > There's also a new-ish [Urban Sketchers group here in Pittsburgh](https://www.facebook.com/groups/456041198545362 'The Pittsburgh Urban Sketchers Facebook group'), and I'd like to begin attending some of their events.
- Learn to paint with acrylics
  > I've worked with watercolor paints for almost 15 years, but I have yet to work much with acrylic (or oil) paints. I'm beginning to experiment with acrylics when I find the time. I ended up getting a lot of my late grandmother's paints and I hope I can put them to good use.
