In the spirit of [Derek Sivers'](https://sivers.org/ "Derek Sivers' website") ["now page"](http://nownownow.com/about 'About the now page'), here is a list of things I'm currently doing my best to focus my attention on.

- Learn to paint with acrylics
  > I've worked with watercolor paints for almost 15 years, but I have yet to work much with acrylic (or oil) paints. I'm beginning to experiment with acrylics when I find the time. I ended up getting a lot of my late grandmother's paints and I hope I can put them to good use.
- Making time to do more with art in general
  > I've really let all my art making go by the wayside. I used to sketch and work with watercolor paints all the time, often multiple times a week. Then that activity sort of dropped off. I want to get that going again. Not just with sketching and watercolor painting, but also making collage art. I've been collecting (and buying) old papers and interesting materials to use in collage pieces without ever making any. It's time to change that.

  > There's also a new-ish [Urban Sketchers group here in Pittsburgh](https://www.facebook.com/groups/456041198545362 'The Pittsburgh Urban Sketchers Facebook group'), and I'd like to begin attending some of their events.
- Clean up [bestboardgamedeals.com](https://bestboardgamedeals.com/ 'A handy website to keep track of forum posts highlighting board game deals')
  > I built this a few years ago as a simple Python web/feed scraper, to collect sales and auctions of board games. It's had its Reddit scraper blocked and the design is quite basic. I'll get the Reddit data working again, and I'll start saving to posts to a database instead of only using current data from the sites I'm getting data from.
